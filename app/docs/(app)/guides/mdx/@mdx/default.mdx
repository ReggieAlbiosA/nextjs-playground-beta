      ## With MDX - page.mdx
     
      This page is rendered using standard MDX syntax, making it ideal for content-rich documentation like routing guides. MDX allows you to write Markdown for structure and clarity while embedding interactive components such as code examples. However, it does come with trade-offs â€” type safety is limited, runtime errors can be harder to debug due to vague messages, and features like syntax highlighting require external configuration. Still, for content-first experiences with light interactivity, MDX provides an efficient and clean balance between developer control and editorial productivity.

        ## File-System Based Routings

        Next.js uses a file-system based router. The App Router, introduced in Next.js 13, builds upon this concept.

        -   `app/page.tsx` corresponds to the `/` route.
        -   `app/about/page.tsx` corresponds to the `/about` route.

        ### Dynamic Routes  

        To create a dynamic route, you use brackets in the folder name. For example, `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` will match routes like `/blog/hello-world` or `/blog/another-post`. The `slug` parameter will be available in your component.

        Here is an example of how to access the slug parameter:

        ```tsx
        // app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
        export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
          return <div>My Post: {params.slug}</div>
        }
        ```

        ### Layouts

        Layouts are used to share UI between multiple pages. A layout in a directory applies to all pages within that directory and its subdirectories. For example, `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` would be a layout for all pages under `/dashboard`.

        ```tsx
        // app/dashboard/layout.tsx
        export default function DashboardLayout({
          children,
        }: {
          children: React.ReactNode
        }) {
          return (
            <section>
              {/* Include shared UI here e.g. a header or sidebar */}
              <nav>Dashboard Nav</nav>

              {children}
            </section>
          )
        }
        ```

        ### Conclusion

        The Next.js App Router provides a powerful and intuitive way to structure your application's routes. By understanding file conventions for pages, layouts, and dynamic routes, you can build complex applications with ease.
